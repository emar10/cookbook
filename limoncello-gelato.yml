ingredients:
  - name: whole milk
    amount: 3
    unit: cups
  - name: granulated sugar
    unit: 3/4 cup
  - name: limoncello
    unit: 1/4 cup
  - name: large egg yolks
    amount: 5
  - name: lemons
    amount: 2

steps:
  - In a medium saucepan, heat the milk on medium until it reaches a bare simmer, then remove from heat.
  - While the milk heats, combine the sugar and egg yolks in a medium heat-safe bowl, and mix using a hand mixer on medium speed until the sugar has fully dissolved.
  - Temper the egg mixture by adding the milk to the bowl a little at a time while constantly mixing on low speed.
  - Once fully combined, move the mixture back to the saucepan.
  - Heat the custard on medium-low, while stirring constantly, until it thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon (be careful not to heat past 180â„‰).
  - Allow the custard to cool, then cover and refrigerate for at least several hours (ideally overnight).
  - Prepare an ice cream maker per manufacturer instructions.
  - Pass the custard through a fine mesh strainer before adding to the ice cream maker, then immediately add limoncello.
  - When the gelato is finished churning, move to a freezer-safe container and mix in lemon zest and juice to taste by hand. I recommend starting with the zest of one lemon and adding juice from half of a lemon at a time.
  - Freeze for at least 2 hours.
  - Take the gelato out of the freezer 5-10 minutes before serving for the ideal texture.
